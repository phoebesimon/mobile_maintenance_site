Feature: submit a maintenance request

  As a resident of the dorms
  So that I can get things fixed
  I want to be able to submit maintenance request

Background: 
  Given I am on the home page

Scenario: submit a request for a room in Foothill
  When I press the "submit a maintenance request" button
  Then I should be on the request page
  And I should see "Submit a Request"
  And I enter "foothill" into the location field
  And I enter "8d34d" into the room field
  And I enter "light is broken" into the description field
  And I press the "submit" button
  Then I should be on the review page
  And I should see that my location is "foothill"
  And I should see that my room is "8d34d"
  And I should see that my description is "light is broken"
  And I press the "confirm" button
  Then I should be on the home page
  And I should see "request submitted"
